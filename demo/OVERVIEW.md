2. Daily sales of R500 are processed through the system
3. Mix of cash and mobile money payments are recorded
4. After 2 months: 120 transactions, R30,000 total sales
5. System calculates Township Credit Score: 78 (Good rating)
6. Thabo becomes eligible for R3,000 microloan at 15% interest
7. Successful repayment improves score to 85 (Excellent)
8. Higher loan amounts become available for business expansion
