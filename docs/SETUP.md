# Setup Instructions - Township POS + Credit Score System

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

## Quick Start (Recommended)

### Option 1: One-Command Setup
```bash
./run.sh
```
This automatically starts both backend and frontend servers.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd src/backend
```

2. Start the server (no virtual environment needed):
```bash
python3 server_5001.py
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5001`

**Note**: The system uses a lightweight HTTP server that doesn't require Flask installation.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd src/frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Database & Demo Data

### Automatic Database Creation
The system uses SQLite database which will be automatically created when you first run the backend server.

### Load Demo Data (Recommended)

```bash
cd scripts
python3 gamification_demo.py
```
